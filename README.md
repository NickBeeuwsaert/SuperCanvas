SuperCanvas
===========
What is this conglomeration of javascript you ask?  
WELL! SuperCanvas is:  

 *  a SVG command parser!  
 *  a collection of utilities for doing repetitive tasks in HTML5 canvas  
 *  utilities to simplify doing things in HTML5 canvas that should (IMHO) have already been added to canvas  
 *  Just plain cool!  

So yeah! what are you waiting for? Check it out, and file bugs, because I hate finding bugs myself!
